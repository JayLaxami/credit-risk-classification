# credit-risk-classification

Dataset of historical lending activity from a peer-to-peer lending services company to build a model that can identify the creditworthiness of borrowers.

Data is split into Training and Testing Sets.

 Logistic Regression Model is created with the Original Data and Oversampled Data with Resampled Training Data.
 
 It was recorded that : In this oversampled data, the precision for healthy loan is 1.0 which is at-par and for high-risk loan, it is 0.84 which is also good but in comparision with healthy loan it is less. Their recall values is almost similar. 
As compared to above report of original data, precision for high-risk loan is reduced by 1%. In original data, precision for high-risk loan is 0.85 and in this oversampled data, it is 0.84. Also, the recall value for high-risk loan in oversampled data is better than above report. 
Lastly, comparing the accuracy score for oversampled data is better (0.99) than above original data(0.95).
